# About
Inter4D is Windows desktop application for 4D geometry visualisation. Its main goal is to help you develop better understanding of four-dimensional space, allowing you to view projections and intersections of four-dimensional geometric figures, change their orientations and perspective. The application contains a set of predefined 4D shapes, involving all [regular polytopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope), hypersphere, hypercylinder, hypercone and demo concave shape. As a reference, there is an option to switch between 4D and 3D mode to compare the features of analogous objects.

# Download
You can get a free copy of the application here:
[https://github.com/robert-salata/Inter4D/tree/main/app](https://github.com/robert-salata/Inter4D/tree/main/app)
Just download the repository, unpack it and launch Inter4D.exe.
**Note**: The application is developed for Windows systems only and requires hardware compatible with DirectX 11.
